<h1>Description</h1>

*This application is a YouTube clone. It allows a user to enter a search query, and it will return a list of videos off that search. I have patched the request query to only allow for at most 30 videos to be returned
*I built the UI using React and handled the API requests with Axios using AJAX
\*Depending on time of reading this MD, I have already or I do plan to add more design and more functionality as follows
-add sharing functionality (to twitter, instagram and facebook)
-display comments of that video
-allow the user to actually use their own account to search for videos
-add another layer of functionality for logging in a user
